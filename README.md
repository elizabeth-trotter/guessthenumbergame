# Guess the Number Game :grey_question:

**Name:** Elizabeth Trotter

**Project Note:** This project was the culmination of all that I had learned within my first two weeks of learning to write code. Each day was full of `flowcharts`, `psuedocode`, and mini challenges to practice the art of `learning to think like a programmer`. I remember feeling very proud of not only getting this particular game to work, but also writing code that didn't break (even when a user ***purposely*** tried to break it). This was when I truly learned the importance of `data validation`. Although this concept had previously been discussed during morning lectures, I didn't fully grasp it until implementation in this project. 

*Thank you to all my peers for your invaluable feedback and for agreeing to play my random games!*
